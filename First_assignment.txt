1. WHAT ARE YOUR MOTIVATIONS TOWARDS BIOINFORMATICS?
I have developed huge interest and passion towards Bioinformatics through my classes during Undergraduate peroid.. 
Those classes made me curious to know about the language, programming, etc...
Even though, I am not familiar with the language and programming , the concept of Bioinformatics made me eager to learn widely in this field..
I am sure that i will be in the dry lab field in my future years.. because of my some health problems. And that pushes me to learn the science knowledge in a different way.
